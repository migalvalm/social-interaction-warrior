# Social Interaction Warrior

A take on Arena Survival and Social Interactions mixed with a "Vampire Survivors" battle system and a rogue-lite abilities build system, where the weapons are phrases and your personality is set by the pair of glasses you decide to use.

Kinda sounds like life right?

## Loop

- Choose your Glasses and fight with the main ability of it
- Evolve your abilities and player, in a rogue-lite format
- Become the strongest debater in the streets
